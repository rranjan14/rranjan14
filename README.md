## About Me 
I'm a passionate technologist with a diverse background in software development. I started my journey as a full stack developer, where I gained hands-on experience building end-to-end web applications and working with various frameworks and databases. This role helped me develop a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies.

I then transitioned into mobile development, specializing in [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). This allowed me to create cross-platform mobile applications and gave me valuable insights into the mobile ecosystem. I enjoyed the challenge of optimizing app performance and creating seamless user experiences across different devices.
Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence. I find the rapid advancements in AI fascinating and am actively learning about all things AI and their practical applications. It's exciting to be part of this transformative field.

I'm particularly drawn to cutting-edge technologies and the startup ecosystem. The fast-paced environment and opportunity to work on innovative solutions really energize me. I thrive in spaces where I can push technological boundaries and contribute to projects that have the potential to make a significant impact.
